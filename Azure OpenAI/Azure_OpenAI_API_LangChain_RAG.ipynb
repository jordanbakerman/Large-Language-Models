If yoususpect that a player has played a Wild Draw 4 card illegally, you may challengethem. A challenged player must show his/her hand to the player who challenged. Ifthe challenged player is guilty, he/she must draw 4 cards. If the challenged player isnot guilty, the challenger must draw the 4 cards, plus 2 additional cards.\n",
